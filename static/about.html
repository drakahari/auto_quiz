<h1>About DLMS</h1>

<p>
DLMS (Drakahari's Learning &amp; Management System) is a self-contained quiz and
assessment application designed for serious learning and exam preparation. The user is able to toggle between a timed Exam mode
and a flexible Study mode, making DLMS suitable for both high-stakes testing and low-pressure studying. Study mode
offers features such as instant feedback to facilitate learning. The correct answer/s will turn green when selected. 
Incorrect answer/s will be highlighted in red. 
This immediate feedback mechanism enhances the learning experience by
allowing users to learn from their mistakes in real-time. Exam mode simulates a formal testing environment
with strict time limits and no feedback until the end. There is pause functionality in Exam mode to accommodate real-world testing scenarios.
In pause mode the screen will be blurred out and the timer will stop counting down. As Sample Quiz is included to showcase DLMS's features and capabilities,
users can explore and understand how to effectively utilize the system for their learning needs.

<h2>Design Philosophy</h2>

<p>
DLMS prioritizes correctness, reliability, and user ownership. It does not
require internet access, user accounts, or external services. DLMS has strong code functiionality
that allows users to harness the power of regex to properly parse quiz questions and answers. 
This ensures that users can create complex quizzes that accurately assess knowledge and understanding.
